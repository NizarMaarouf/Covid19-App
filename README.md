# Covid19-App
Problem
We have a problem that our covid api does not give us the ability to choose
statistics between continent countries. It only gives you statistics of the whole world.
Solution
The solution is to call our countries api and choose from their the specific
continent you want the list of countries from and compare those countries to our covid 19 countries.
